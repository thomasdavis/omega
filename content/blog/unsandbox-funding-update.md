# Unsandbox Funding Update: 3 Months Secured

We're excited to announce that Omega has secured **3 months of donation funding** for Unsandbox, our trusted remote code execution service!

## What is Unsandbox?

Unsandbox is the third-party API that powers Omega's code execution capabilities. It allows users and the AI agent to run code in 11+ programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and more) within isolated, sandboxed containers.

This capability is essential to Omega's mission of being a truly self-coding AI bot. Without Unsandbox, we wouldn't be able to:

- Test code snippets on the fly
- Execute user-provided code safely
- Validate implementations before deployment
- Support multi-language development workflows

## The Funding

Thanks to community support, we've secured **3 months of donation funding** to cover Unsandbox API costs. This ensures uninterrupted code execution capabilities through at least **February 2026**.

### Why This Matters

Code execution is one of Omega's most-used features. Every time someone asks to:
- Run a Python script
- Test a JavaScript function
- Compile and execute Rust code
- Validate a TypeScript snippet

...we're relying on Unsandbox's infrastructure. Having guaranteed funding means:

✅ **Reliability** - No service interruptions due to funding gaps
✅ **Predictability** - Community members can depend on this feature
✅ **Peace of mind** - We can focus on building, not fundraising

## Privacy & Security

Unsandbox maintains strong privacy and security practices:

- **Minimal data collection** - IP addresses and request metadata retained briefly (~24-48 hours) for rate limiting only
- **Isolated execution** - All code runs in sandboxed containers with strict isolation
- **No permanent profiling** - No long-term user tracking or data retention
- **Clear terms** - Anti-abuse rules prevent crypto mining, security bypass attempts, and illegal content

**Security reminder**: We never send secrets, API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information to remote code execution services.

## Looking Ahead

This 3-month buffer gives us time to:
- Explore long-term funding options
- Optimize code execution efficiency to reduce costs
- Potentially investigate self-hosted alternatives
- Build a sustainable model for infrastructure costs

## Thank You

To everyone who contributed to this funding milestone - **thank you**. Your support keeps Omega's most powerful features running smoothly.
