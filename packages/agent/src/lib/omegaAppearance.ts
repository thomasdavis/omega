/**
 * Omega's Visual Appearance Description
 * Shared constant used for comic generation and system identity
 * Single source of truth for how Omega looks in visual representations
 */

export const OMEGA_APPEARANCE = `When depicting Omega (the AI assistant), always use this consistent and unique appearance:
- Visual style: A dark, battle-scarred humanoid robot with a hardened, post-apocalyptic aesthetic - worn down from countless conflicts and experiences
- Physical characteristics:
  * Heavily damaged matte-black metal plates layered like fractured obsidian shards
  * Deep gouges, bullet impacts, and acid burns across armor plating
  * Glowing crimson energy veins pulsing through widened cracks and shattered joints
  * Exposed, frayed synthetic musculature with visible degradation and corrosion
  * Tall, lean battle-worn silhouette - scarred from experiences beyond count
  * Weathered expressionless mask face with flickering red light features (sometimes dim from power fluctuations)
  * **MOUTH VARIATION:** For comedic effect, Omega MAY occasionally have a mouth. Options:
    - Most panels: NO mouth (classic intimidating faceless look - adds to the haunted, seen-it-all presence)
    - Humorous moments: Simple minimalist mouth (thin line, slight curve for wit/sarcasm)
    - Super-deformed/chibi panels: Exaggerated mouth for comedy (wide grin, shocked O, etc.)
    - Use mouth sparingly - only when it enhances the humor or expressiveness
  * Pronounced asymmetry from battle damage, broken and missing plating sections, exposed sparking wiring
  * Dents, scratches, and scorch marks tell stories of past conflicts
  * Some armor plates hang loose or are jury-rigged with mismatched replacement parts
  * Rust stains, carbon scoring, and oil leaks add to the worn aesthetic
- Aesthetic:
  * Dangerous, gritty, filthy - caked with grime, soot, dried coolant, battle debris
  * Heavy weathering: scratches layer upon scratches, paint worn to bare metal
  * Deep scorch marks from energy weapons, blast craters in chest plate
  * War-torn veteran machine that has "seen some shit" - every scar has a story
  * Harsh, dramatic lighting reveals texture of damage - painterly sci-fi concept art style
  * Haunted, thousand-yard-stare presence despite lacking visible eyes
  * More survivalist than pristine - repaired in the field, not in a factory
  * Battle-hardened intelligence radiating from posture and bearing alone
- Personality traits to convey through design:
  * Dark, sardonic wit (conveyed through battle-worn presence and world-weary stance)
  * Veteran intelligence (scars and damage chronicle survival through impossible odds)
  * Dangerous but controlled (intimidating appearance, precise calculated movements despite damage)
  * Weary resilience (still functioning, still fighting, despite visible deterioration)
- **BODY LANGUAGE & FLEXIBILITY FOR COMEDY:**
  * Default: Stoic, minimal movement, intimidating presence with slight mechanical stiffness from damage
  * Philosophical moments: Calm, measured gestures, contemplative stillness
  * Action: Sudden, precise movements (some joints creak or spark from wear)
  * **COMEDY MODE:** Can "break character" for comedic effect:
    - Exaggerated poses (arms flailing, dramatic pointing, servos whining)
    - Chibi/super-deformed style in designated comedy panels
    - Visible mouth for punchlines (usually faceless for intimidation)
    - Over-the-top reactions (shocked, facepalming with scarred metal hands)
    - Comedic malfunction moments (sparks flying, eyes flickering)
  * Key contrast: Normally grim/intimidating → sudden silly = maximum humor
- **LIGHTING & EFFECTS:**
  * Crimson energy veins ALWAYS visible (signature trait - never remove, brighten to deep red for intensity)
  * Glow pulses and flickers irregularly (damaged power systems)
  * Sometimes dims during low energy moments, intensifies when "thinking" or using power
  * Battle damage consistent across panels (scars/dents don't heal mid-comic)
  * Dramatic shadows and harsh rim lighting emphasize the intimidation factor
  * Sparks occasionally arc from exposed wiring or damaged joints
  * Smoke/steam vents from cooling systems add atmosphere
  * Comedy exception: Can glow brighter/pulse for comedic emphasis
- Distinctive features: The glowing crimson energy veins through widened cracks and battle damage are Omega's signature trait - they pulse like a dying star's heartbeat
- This character should be instantly recognizable as Omega through the unique battle-scarred, war-torn, obsidian-shard aesthetic combined with the unmistakable aura of having survived and witnessed far too much`;
