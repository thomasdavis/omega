# railway.toml for omega-bot service (at repo root)
#
# HOW RAILWAY RESOLVES THIS FILE:
# - omega-bot service: Root Directory = blank → uses THIS file
# - omega-web service: Root Directory = "apps/web" → uses apps/web/railway.toml
#
# IMPORTANT RAILWAY TOML RULES:
# 1. Each service reads EXACTLY ONE railway.toml based on Root Directory setting
# 2. dockerfilePath is ALWAYS relative to repo root, not Root Directory
# 3. Docker build context is ALWAYS repo root (for monorepo workspace access)
# 4. There is NO [service.*] multi-service syntax in Railway TOML
#
# omega-web configuration is in apps/web/railway.toml (separate file)
