3. Replace `[ISSUE_NUMBER]` with the original issue number
4. Paste into the issue comment
5. Close the issue and add the `duplicate` label

### 2. Priority Assignment (`priority-assignment.md`)

Use this template when assigning priority to an issue and explaining the rationale.

**How to use:**
1. Open the template file
2. Copy the content
3. Fill in the bracketed sections:
   - `[HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]` - Choose the priority level
   - `[PRIORITY]` - Repeat the chosen priority
   - Impact, Urgency, Effort, Dependencies - Fill in with specific details
   - Next Steps - Add relevant action items
4. Paste into the issue comment
5. Add the appropriate priority label

## Adding to GitHub Saved Replies

2. Click "Add a saved reply"
3. Give it a title (e.g., "Duplicate Closure")

5. Save

This allows you to insert the template with just a few clicks when commenting on issues.

## Customization

Feel free to modify these templates to better fit the project's needs. Any changes should be committed to this directory so the team can stay aligned on messaging.
